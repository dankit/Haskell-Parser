# Haskell-Parser
I worked on this project in university during my senior year, in which we had to implement a text parser in Haskell. Some of the code is boilerplate,
all my personal code is located within [here](/Parser.hs). Key ideas include tail recursion (for parsing numbers), pattern matching, etc.
